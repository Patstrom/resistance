The Resistance is a game that I sometimes play with my friends.

We just started a round online (in skype mainly) and I figured it shouldn't be too hard
to create my own The Resistance game online, even though I have absolutetly zero experience
with web design and front-end. I was wrong. But now I am stuck.

## Build & Run
```Bash
pip install --user flask
```

```
python main.py
```
